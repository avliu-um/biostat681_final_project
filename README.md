# biostat681_final_project

Scraping portion of BIOSTAT681 Final Project

Overarching goal is to scrape chess-results.com website for games, 
and perform statistical modeling (i.e. regression) to test whether having games online causes more cheating to occur,
as proxied by the number of upsets (i.e. low-ranked beating high-ranked player).

Work for scraping was divided in two:
- Scrape tournament and game information: scrape.ipynb
- Scrape player-related attributes: fide_scraper.ipynb and chess_results_player_scraper_final.ipynb
